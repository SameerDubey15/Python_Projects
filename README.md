# Major Projects
Here are some of the projects made by me in VS Code using Python language

## Hand Cricket Game
Hand cricket is a very intriguing game. It is best when you are bored and have no equipment to play any sophisticated sport. It just requires two people’s involvement, and they play the game based on some set rules. The game begins with choosing odd and even, and then there is a toss in which the winner gets the opportunity to select either bowling or batting.
If a person wants to score one run, he throws scissors with the help of his hand. If one wants to score four, he needs to add his index finger to three, and for a whopping six, one needs to make a clenched fist with a thumb extension. Although the game is quite simple, and it can extend for a very long duration too. But it has set rules for wickets too. A person gets out when he loses his wicket, and the game terminates at that particular score for him. One person gets out when both the parties throw the same signs. If you are a winner of the toss and you are batting, but you and the other individual show the same sign then the game is over. Then, the next person gets the chance to play and beat your score. It is how this exciting game is played.

### Hand Cricket Rules
For marking 1, one needs to throw the fingers, giving rise to an index finger’s extension. For attaining 2, just make scissors indication. To score 3, indicate only the middle, ring, and little fingers extended. For acquiring 4, sum up your index finger to three. Throw paper hints for 5 and clasp your fist with only a thumb expansion for collecting 6. The rules for a wicket are quite simple; one gets out when both the individuals involved make the same signs.


## Flappy Bird Game
Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the touchscreen. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay. During the game over screen, the player is awarded a bronze medal if they reached ten or more points, a silver medal from twenty points, a gold medal from thirty points, and a platinum medal from forty points

### How to Play
 1. Start the game
 2. Stay in the middle of screen until the first set of pipes appears
 3. Stay in the middle of the pipes
 4. Find your rhythm for higher and lower pipes
 5. Try not to go high


## Voice Assistant
This is a youtube guided project.
Purpose of virtual assistant is to being capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information, such as news.
